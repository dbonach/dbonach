- 👋 Hi, I’m @deivitbonach, electrical engineering student at University of Campinas in Brazil.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning web development with python, javascript.

</br>

I have been developing a few projects from online courses and I’d like to share them to show what I have been learning and my capabilities as a future web developer.

The projects on top are more recent, as a result they could have a better quality in general.
