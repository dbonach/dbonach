- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @deivitbonach, electrical engineering student at University of Campinas in Brazil.
- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning web development with Python/Django and Javascript.

</br>

I have been developing a few projects from online courses and I‚Äôd like to share them to show what I have been learning and my capabilities as a future web developer. I have interest in both, front and back-end.

The projects on the top are more recent, as a result they could have a better quality in general. The two projects at the bottom are related to microcontrollers.
